    # ever initializing a `nflgame.game.Game` object, which can be costly.

    # in the current season that haven't started yet. Or more usefully,
    # every game when the database is empty. This chunk of games has its
    # drives and play bulk-inserted.
    #
    # The third and final chunk are games that are being played. These games
    # have the slowest update procedure since each drive and play need to be
    # "upserted." That is, inserted if it doesn't exist or updated if it
    # does. On the scale of a few games, performance should be reasonable.
